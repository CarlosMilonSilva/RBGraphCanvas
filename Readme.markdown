# ![](https://raw.github.com/alexrestrepo/RBComposer/master/class.png) RBGraph Canvas

A canvas that will draw an x,y line graph of one or multiple "datasets", you can modify almost every aspect of the resulting graph. Look at the included demo for an example.
Not a replacement for excel :P but quite useful for simple graphs.

Uses the XMLDictionary extension by Kevin Ballard to save and load graph data.
